# Project Euler 39 - Integer right triangles
# If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length
# sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

# {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

# For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

# EDIT: November 4, 2017
# Came back to this problem today and rewrote it. Solution in Ruby now takes
# about 35 ms. Nice to see some improvement in my code-writing skills!
# Find new code below, and old solution at bottom of the page.
