How many hands does Player 1 win?

ANSWER: player 1 wins: 376

For this problem, I created card and poker hand 'objects'. I used regular 5 card poker rules
as a guideline to create a scoring system, and scored each two poker hands on each line
against each other, keeping tally of the scores.

Usage: ruby 054_poker_hands.rb p054_poker.txt
